## Write a paragraph about something new you learned in class within the past 24 hours.

In the last class, we briefly saw some model selection criteria (AIC, BIC, ...), and then we worked on the final projects.  

## Write a paragraph about something you are struggling to understand that was covered in class within the past 24 hours.

In the last class, I was mostly working on the final project and didn't have anything I struggled to follow.

## Is there anything else you would like me to be aware of?
