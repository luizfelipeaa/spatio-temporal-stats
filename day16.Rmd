## Write a paragraph about something new you learned in class within the past 24 hours.

During the last class, I worked on Activity 2 and implemented one of the Generalized Additive Models (GAM) to predict elevation. Additionally, I had the opportunity to discuss the final project with Aidan.

## Write a paragraph about something you are struggling to understand that was covered in class within the past 24 hours.

I find myself getting somewhat lost to write out the more complex models, such as gradient boosting and random forests.

## Is there anything else you would like me to be aware of?

The work days are very beneficial for us, as they allow us to put into practice what we learn in class.
