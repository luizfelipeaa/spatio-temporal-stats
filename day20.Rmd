## Write a paragraph about something new you learned in class within the past 24 hours.

This class focused on the final project, providing me the opportunity to discuss priors for non-linear models in agriculture, discuss model convergence, and also the application of the area under the curve (AUC) for non-linear models.

## Write a paragraph about something you are struggling to understand that was covered in class within the past 24 hours.

I did not have any struggle in the last class.

## Is there anything else you would like me to be aware of?

It was good to know that my plans for the final project are on the right track. I am making progress and planning to start writing the tutorial and report soon.
