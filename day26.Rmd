## Write a paragraph about something new you learned in class within the past 24 hours.

We first visualized all earthquakes since 1977, focusing on the temporal effects only (no spatial considerations), and the locations of wells in Kansas. We then extrapolated the number of earthquakes to a specific area (100 $km^2$). Predicting the intensity of earthquakes in Kansas proved challenging. We also forecasted the expected number of earthquakes in a 1,000 $km^2$ area for the year 2024. We discussed the impact of adding or removing wells in a given region using a regression-style approach, which allows us to manipulate these variables as needed. Lastly, we reviewed the white-nose bat infection dataset in the US.

## Write a paragraph about something you are struggling to understand that was covered in class within the past 24 hours.

I don't fully comprehend the partial differential equations, although I managed to follow the example discussed in class.

## Is there anything else you would like me to be aware of?
