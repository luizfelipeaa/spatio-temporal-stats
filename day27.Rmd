# Day 27


## Write a paragraph about something new you learned in class within the past 24 hours.

Last class I worked on the final project and tutorial.

## Write a paragraph about something you are struggling to understand that was covered in class within the past 24 hours.

Last class was very clear to me, and I do not have any current struggle.

## Is there anything else you would like me to be aware of?
